        /* Task01:
        create a class called KgTopounds, and write a program that can convert Kg to pound and print the result
                Ex:
        kg = 10;
        output:
        10 kg equal to 22.0462 pounds
                kg = 20
        output:
        20 kg equal to 44.0924 pounds
                ....
        Hint: 1kg = 2.20462 pounds
        Task02:
        create a class called GalonsToLiters, and write a program that can convert the gallons tto litters
                Ex:
        galon = 10;
        output:
        10 gallons equal to 37.8541 liters
                galon = 20
        output:
        20 gallons equal to 75.7082 liters
        Hint: 1 gallon = 3.78541 liters
        Task03:
        create a class called LiraToUSD, and write a program that can convert lira to dollars, and print the result
                Ex:
        Lira = 1000;
        output:
        1000 Lira is equal to 160.97 USD
                Lira = 1000000;
        output:
        1000000 Lira equal to 160969.70 USD */
